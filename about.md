# Daily Stars
Simple mod that adds a new stat in the **garage** (Where you can change your icons) and also in the **level search page** showing the number of stars you've collected **in a day**.

# Settings
There are three settings :
- **Toggle** the visibility of the stat in the **garage**
- **Toggle** the visibility of the stat in the **level search page**
- **Toggle** the visibility of the **particules** behind the daily star icon

# About me
This is a mod I had the idea to make while stargrinding, and I have absolutely **zero C++ knowledge**.
